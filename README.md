# Implementation-of-scheduling-algorithms-OS-
In my project, I explored various Operating System (OS) scheduling algorithms. The project involves the implementation of different scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, NPPS, PPS, and RR). input is taken through a text file, and accordingly, memory allocation or reallocation is done.Â
